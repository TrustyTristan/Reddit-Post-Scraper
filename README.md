..That's about it really.


## To Do:
- Subreddit filtering
	- Subreddits can be big...
	- Limits, currently just grabs top 25
	- Maybe other things to filter by to only get good stuff
- Stats
- Check if file exists in folder
- Remove duplicate pictures based on picture
- Work around for images requiring authentication
- Understand why you can have while true for the functions
	- Because when you do it doesn't stores old data
